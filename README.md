# Banished Clone

A 2D browser-playable hybrid of [Banished](https://www.shiningrocksoftware.com/) and Stardew Valley — a city-building survival sandbox with deeper citizen personalities, skill progression, festivals, livestock, and narrative events. Guide a group of exiled travelers as they build a new settlement, manage resources, and survive harsh seasons.

Built with TypeScript and HTML5 Canvas. No frameworks, no dependencies beyond Vite.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Gameplay Manual (Web Pages)

The game ships with a gameplay manual site at:

- `manual/index.html` (overview)
- `manual/buildings.html`
- `manual/resources.html`
- `manual/mechanics.html`

In-game access: open the pause menu (`Escape`) and click **Gameplay Manual**. It opens in a new browser tab.

### Manual Update Policy

When gameplay values or systems change, update the manual pages in `public/manual/` in the same PR.
At minimum, review manual accuracy after edits to:

- `src/constants.ts`
- `src/data/BuildingDefs.ts`
- `src/data/ResourceDefs.ts`
- `src/data/RecipeDefs.ts`
- `src/data/SeasonDefs.ts`
- `src/systems/*` (for formula/logic changes)

## How to Play

You start with 20 adults, 2 children, and a stockpile of resources (150 logs, 50 stone, 20 iron, 8 tools, 7 coats, 80 firewood, 200 berries, 100 roots, 50 venison). Place buildings, assign workers, and manage food and firewood to keep your settlement alive through the seasons.

There is no win condition — it's a sandbox survival game. The challenge is avoiding the **death spiral**: resource shortages lead to deaths, which mean fewer workers, which deepens the shortage.

### Controls

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| WASD / Arrow keys | Pan camera |
| Mouse wheel | Zoom in/out |
| Left click | Select citizen or building |
| Right click / Escape | Cancel placement / deselect |
| B | Toggle build menu |
| Space | Pause / unpause |
| 1-5 | Game speed (pause, 1x, 2x, 5x, 10x) |
| F3 | Debug overlay |
| R | Restart (game over screen) |

### Tips

- Build a **Gathering Hut** near forest first — it's your most reliable early food source and works year-round (unlike farms).
- Construction takes real time — a Gathering Hut takes about half a day with your full crew, a house takes almost a full day. Plan accordingly.
- Build a **Wood Cutter** early — firewood keeps houses warm in winter and citizens will freeze without it.
- Don't overbuild. Each building takes workers away from food production, and construction ties up laborers for hours or days.
- Watch food reserves heading into winter. Crops don't grow in cold months, and you'll need stockpiled food to survive.
- Build a **Forester Lodge** to sustain nearby forest tiles that gathering huts depend on. Trees take time to regrow.

## Features

### Citizen Simulation
- Citizens have needs: food, warmth, health, happiness, and energy
- Day/night cycle — citizens sleep at night and when exhausted
- Discrete meals (2-3 per day) with diet variety tracking
- Family formation, housing, children, aging, and natural death
- Education system — schooled citizens produce 50% more
- Social interactions — citizens chat when near each other; loneliness causes unhappiness
- **Personality traits** — hardworking, lazy, cheerful, shy, adventurous (1-2 per citizen, affect work speed, socializing, and happiness)
- **Skill progression** — citizens gain XP in their profession's skill (farming, forestry, cooking, etc.), leveling up to 5 for +5% efficiency per level; mastery grants bonus output

### 27 Building Types

| Category | Buildings |
|----------|-----------|
| Housing | Wooden House |
| Storage | Storage Barn, Stockpile |
| Food | Crop Field, Gathering Hut, Hunting Cabin, Fishing Dock, Bakery, Chicken Coop, Pasture |
| Resource | Forester Lodge, Wood Cutter, Blacksmith, Tailor, Dairy, Stone Quarry, Iron Mine |
| Services | Herbalist, Market, School, Trading Post, Town Hall, Tavern, Well, Chapel |
| Infrastructure | Road, Wooden Bridge |

### 27 Resource Types
- **Raw:** Log, Stone, Iron
- **Food (raw):** Berries, Mushrooms, Roots, Venison, Fish, Wheat, Cabbage, Potato
- **Food (cooked):** Bread, Fish Stew, Berry Pie, Vegetable Soup, Cheese
- **Food (animal):** Eggs, Milk
- **Processed:** Firewood, Tool, Coat, Herbs, Leather, Feathers, Hay, Wool, Cloth

### Cooking & Bakery
- Bakery building converts raw ingredients into cooked meals (Bread, Fish Stew, Berry Pie, Vegetable Soup)
- Cooked meals restore more food and give buffs: warmth (stew/soup), energy (pie), happiness (all)
- Multi-recipe buildings cycle through available recipes based on ingredient availability

### Crop Growth Stages
- Crops progress through visible stages: Fallow → Planted → Sprouting → Growing → Flowering → Ready to Harvest
- Growth rate affected by season, weather, workers, and festival effects
- Unharvested crops die in winter, adding seasonal pressure

### Animals & Livestock
- **Chicken Coop** — raises chickens for eggs and feathers; needs hay
- **Pasture** — raises cattle for milk, wool, and leather; cattle suffer in winter
- **Dairy** — converts milk into cheese
- **Tailor** — now also crafts cloth from wool
- Crop harvests produce hay to feed animals; animals breed when healthy and below capacity

### Festivals & Town Hall
- Town Hall unlocks 4 seasonal festivals: Planting Day (spring), Midsummer (summer), Harvest Festival (autumn), Frost Fair (winter)
- During festivals: citizens gather at Town Hall, happiness boost, lantern particles
- Lingering effects: crop growth boost, happiness multiplier, reduced spoilage, reduced disease

### Social Buildings
- **Tavern** — citizens visit in evening hours for happiness (needs a barkeep)
- **Well** — passive happiness radius for nearby citizens (decorative)
- **Chapel** — boosts newlywed happiness; provides community-wide morale

### Milestones & Narrative Events
- 10 milestones (First House, Winter Survivors, Population 10/20/50, First Trade, etc.) grant permanent bonuses
- Random narrative events tied to individual citizens ("found wild berries", "told a story by the fire")
- Milestones and events appear in the event log and as notifications

### Seasonal Cycle
- 12 sub-seasons per year (Early/Mid/Late Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter)
- Crops grow in spring-summer, harvest in autumn, nothing in winter
- Temperature affects warmth decay — citizens freeze without firewood and coats
- Visual changes: snow in winter, colored leaves in autumn

### Survival Mechanics
- **Food spoilage** — food decays over time; Storage Barns reduce spoilage by 80%
- **Resource depletion** — forests thin out when gathered; stone and iron deposits deplete
- **Tool & coat wear** — tools and coats degrade with use
- **Building decay** — buildings lose durability over time and can collapse
- **Disease** — malnourished citizens get sick; illness spreads; Herbalists cure nearby sick citizens
- **Weather events** — storms damage buildings and crops, droughts halt crop growth, cold snaps increase warmth drain

### Game Balance
All gameplay values are centralized in config files for easy tuning:
- `src/constants.ts` — core tuning values (timing, needs, construction, AI, etc.)
- `src/data/BuildingDefs.ts` — per-building costs, sizes, and construction times
- `src/data/RecipeDefs.ts` — production recipes, cooldowns, and yields
- `src/data/SeasonDefs.ts` — seasonal temperature, crop growth, and gathering rates

### Other Systems
- Nomad arrivals bring new citizens (and sometimes disease)
- Merchant traders visit the Trading Post for resource bartering
- Particle effects: chimney smoke, snowfall, falling leaves, festival lanterns
- Minimap with camera indicator
- Detailed info panels for selected citizens and buildings (traits, skills, livestock, crop stages)
- Save/load system with IndexedDB and localStorage fallback

## Architecture

Lightweight Entity Component System (ECS) with 16 game systems, all rendered on a single HTML5 Canvas. Fixed-timestep simulation at 10 ticks/sec with variable-rate rendering. All gameplay values are data-driven through centralized config files. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for technical details.
